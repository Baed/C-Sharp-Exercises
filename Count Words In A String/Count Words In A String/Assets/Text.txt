Thank you for the introduction, robot.  It is a pleasure to meet you and have my words read and counted by you.  Please review what I have provided in this text file and let me know the final count of words.

I also wanted
to provide some text
that is broken up with
new lines so that I can better
understand
how
well you are 
able
to

read and execute your job.
